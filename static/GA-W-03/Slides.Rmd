# Atmospheric window
- The Earth‚Äôs atmosphere selectively transmits energy of certain wavelengths. 
- The wavelength easily transmitted through the atmosphere can be referred as atmospheric windows.
- Only radiation in these wavelengths can be transmitted through the atmosphere.
- Atmospheric windows are mainly due to the effect of absorption within the atmosphere. 

<img src="images/Atm-win.jpg" class="w-50 br4 dib center">

Atmospheric window are significant for remote sensing, because energy within the windows convey information about the radiometric properties of the objects and thus helps produce satellite images.

# Remote sensing data acquisition is limited through these atmospheric windows]

1. .b.blue[Wavelengths shorter than 0.1 Œºm:] Absorbed by Nitrogen and other gaseous components.
2. .b.blue[Wavelengths shorter than 0.3Œºm (X- rays, Gamma rays and part of ultraviolet rays):] Mostly absorbed by the ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).
3. .b.blue[Visible part of the spectrum:] Little absorption occurs.
4. .b.blue[Oxygen in the atmosphere causes absorption centered at 6.3Œºm]
5. .b.blue[Infrared (IR) radiation:] Mainly absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide molecules.
6. .b.blue[Far infrared region]: Mostly absorbed by the atmosphere.
7. .b.blue[Microwave region:] Absorption is almost nil.

# Platforms and sensors
- A platform is the vehicle or carrier for remote sensors for which they are borne.

- Platforms are used to mount sensors which obtain data for remote sensing purposes.

- Platforms are classified according to their heights and events to be monitored.

--

- Platforms used for remote sensing:
  - Ground based
  - Airborne 
  - Space borne

# Remote Sensing Sensors
- Sensor is an electronic circuit which can record the electromagnetic radiation incident upon it
- It senses a variation in input energy to produce a variation in another or same form of energy.
- Sensor comprise of several components such as: 
  - System to receive radiation from the pixel and a telescope (objective),
  - Calibration source and spectrometer,
  - Amplifier and recording system.

# Classification of Remote Sensing Sensors
<img src="images/Classification.jpg" class="w-50 br4 dib center">
.gray.center[Remote sensing sensors classification.  `r Citep(bib, "joseph2005fundamentals")`]

The sensors classified based on their working principles and recording methodology:
1. Photographic camera
1. The vidicon using detecting media as television camera
1. The optical scanner
1. Microwave radiometer
1. Microwave radar

# Ground Resolution versus Repeatability
.pull-left[
- The choice of a remote sensing system with its achievable resolution and with the repeatability to obtain data.

- Geostationary meteorological satellites such as Meteosat permit the imaging of the entire hemisphere with 5 km pixels. This can be achieved every 30 minutes.

# Sensors Parameters and Resolution
#### In remote sensing resolution means the resolving power: 

- Capability to identify the presence of two objects
- Capability to identify the properties of the two objects

--

#### 4 types of resolutions are defined for the remote sensing systems
1. Spatial resolution (what area and how detailed)
1. Spectral resolution (what colors ‚Äì bands)
1. Temporal resolution (time of day/season/year)
1. Radiometric resolution (sensitivity of a remote sensor)

# Landsat program
.pull-left[
- The Landsat program is the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. 

- On 23 July 1972, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (remaned to Landsat-1 in 1975). 

- The most recent, Landsat 9, was launched on 27 September 2021.

# Landsat sensors 
- .red.b[Landsat 1 through 5 carried the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS).]

- Landsat 4 and 5 carried both the MSS and Thematic Mapper (TM) instruments.

- Landsat 7 uses the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scanner.

# Spatial Resolution
Size of the smallest dimension on the Earth‚Äôs surface over which an independent measurement can be made by the sensor.

- Expressed by the size of the pixel on the ground in meters

- Controlled by the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV)

Signature from the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù dominates
for the cell and hence the entire cell is
classified as ‚Äúhouse‚Äù.

<br /> <br /> 
Shape and spatial extent of the feature is better
captured. However, some discrepancy is
present along the boundary

<br /> <br /> 
Feature shape and the spatial extent is
more precisely identified
