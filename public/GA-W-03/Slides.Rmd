# Atmospheric window
- The Earth's atmosphere selectively transmits the energy of specific wavelengths. 
- The wavelength easily transmitted through the atmosphere can be called atmospheric windows.
- Only radiation in these wavelengths can be transmitted through the atmosphere.
- Atmospheric windows are mainly due to absorption within the atmosphere. 

<img src="images/Atm-win.jpg" class="w-50 br4 dib center">

Atmospheric windows are significant for remote sensing because energy within the windows conveys information about the radiometric properties of the objects and thus helps produce satellite images.

# Remote sensing data acquisition is limited through these atmospheric windows]

1. .b.blue[Wavelengths shorter than 0.1 Œºm:] Absorbed by Nitrogen and other gaseous components.
2. .b.blue[Wavelengths shorter than 0.3Œºm (X- rays, Gamma rays, and part of ultraviolet rays):] Mostly absorbed by the ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).
3. .b.blue[Visible part of the spectrum:] Little absorption occurs.
4. .b.blue[Oxygen in the atmosphere causes absorption centered at 6.3Œºm]
5. .b.blue[Infrared (IR) radiation:] Mainly absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide molecules.
6. .b.blue[Far infrared region]: Mostly absorbed by the atmosphere.
7. .b.blue[Microwave region:] Absorption is almost nil.

# Remote Sensing Sensors
- Sensor is an electronic circuit that can record the electromagnetic radiation incident upon it
- It senses a variation in input energy to produce a variation in another form of energy.
- Sensor comprises of several components such as: 
  - System to receive radiation from the pixel and a telescope (objective),
  - Calibration source and spectrometer,
  - Amplifier and recording system.

# Sensors Parameters and Resolution
#### In remote sensing, resolution means the resolving power: 

- Capability to identify the presence of two objects
- Capability to identify the properties of the two objects

--

#### 4 types of resolutions are defined for the remote sensing systems
1. Spatial resolution (what area and how detailed)
1. Spectral resolution (what colors ‚Äì bands)
1. Temporal resolution (time of day/season/year)
1. Radiometric resolution (sensitivity of a remote sensor)

# Landsat program

- The Landsat program is the longest-running enterprise for the acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. 

- On 23 July 1972, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (was renamed to Landsat-1 in 1975). 

- The most recent, Landsat 9, was launched on 27 September 2021.

# False Color Images
Images have colors recorded in the visible or non-visible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

--

**Our four most common false-color band combinations are:**

- Near-infrared (red), green (blue), red (green). *This is a traditional band combination helpful in seeing changes in plant health.*

--

- Shortwave infrared (red), near-infrared (green), and green (blue). *Often used to show floods or newly burned land.*

--

- Blue (red), two different shortwave infrared bands (green and blue). *We use this to differentiate between snow, ice, and clouds.*

--

- Thermal infrared. *Usually shown in tones of gray to illustrate temperature.*

# Spectral resolution of a sensor

.pull-left[
The spectral resolution is: 
- Ability of a sensor to define fine wavelength intervals
- Ability of a sensor to resolve the energy received in spectral bandwidth.

Spectral resolution depends on
- Spectral bandwidth of the filter
- Sensitiveness of the detector

The finer the spectral resolution, the narrower the wavelength range for a particular channel or band.

## Finer the spectral resolution, the narrower the wavelength range for a particular channel or band.
.pull-left[
Most remote sensing systems are multi-spectral, using more than one spectral band.

- Spectral resolution of some of the remote sensing systems IRS LISS-III uses four bands: (green), (red), (near IR), and 1.55-1.70.

- The Aqua/Terra MODIS instruments use 36 spectral bands, including three in the visible spectrum.

- Recent development is the hyper-spectral sensors, which detect hundreds of very narrow spectral bands.

# Radiometric Resolution 
While the arrangement of pixels describes the spatial structure of an image, the radiometric characteristics describe the actual information content in an image.

- Every time an image is acquired by a sensor, its sensitivity to the magnitude of the electromagnetic energy determines the
**radiometric resolution**. 

- The more refined the radiometric resolution of a sensor, the more sensitive it is to detecting minor differences in reflected or emitted energy.

---
# Radiometric Resolution 
- Imagery data are represented by positive digital numbers, which vary from 0 to a selected power of 2.

- Each bit records an exponent of power 2.

- The maximum number of brightness levels available depends on the number of bits used in representing the energy recorded.

- Thus, if a sensor used 8 bits to record the data, there would be 2<sub>8</sub> = 256 digital values available, ranging from 0 to 255.

# Gray Scale Image
.pull-left[

- Most raw unprocessed satellite imagery is stored in a grayscale format.

- A gray scale is a color scale that ranges from black to white, with varying intermediate shades of gray.

- A commonly used grayscale for remote sensing image processing is a 256-shade grayscale.
