      <description>This is draft version
With the everyday new large language model (LLM) or reasoning model (LRL), it is tedious to keep track of. As you can use chatgpt or deepseek chat online there are some caveats. You are limited by cost, and privacy. Thus, I thought of setting LLM locally in my windows machine. In this journey I learn a lot about nuance of LLM. First you can download many LLM that are open source (Llama, Deepseek, etc&amp;hellip;) and other you can access via APIs with some cost (OpneAI&amp;rsquo;s chatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Bard, etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>IntroductionGeospatial analysis often involves understanding the spatial relationships between data points. One foundational concept in this domain is the variogram. In this article, we will explore what a variogram is, how it is used in Kriging, and how to compute experimental and semi-variograms for hypothetical borehole data. Finally, we will use these concepts to interpolate water levels across all data points using Kriging.
A Note on Spatial RelationshipsThe First Law of Geography, proposed by Waldo Tobler, states:</description>

      <description>Climatic Data in Hydrological AnalysisClimatic data such as temperature and precipitation are essential for any hydrological analysis. Usually, several years of data are required to do any type of hydrological analysis. The climatic data is obtained from either satellite-based observation or in situ observation.
For hydrological analysis historical precipitation and temperature data is essential. Usually these data can be obtained from Indian Meterolgocal Department (भारतीय मौसम विज्ञान विभाग:IMD) free of cost.</description>
