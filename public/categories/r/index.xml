      <description>HTML slides with Xaringan.Xaringan is an R package for creating slideshows with remark.js through R Markdown.
…from https://github.com/yihui/xaringan
The package name xaringan comes from Sharingan, a dōjutsu in Naruto with two abilities: the “Eye of Insight” and the “Eye of Hypnotism”. A presentation ninja should have these basic abilities, and I think remark.js may help you acquire these abilities, even if you are not a member of the Uchiha clan.</description>

      <description>R is a very versatile statistical tool and programming language. It’s my all-time good-to-go data analysis tool. It is fast, reliable and nifty.
