```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,	collapse = TRUE
)
```

## Using R studio as R-IDE
R studio has multiple windows but the most important are Code editor, console, Environment variable pane, and plot output pane. 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R-Studio IDE have many pans."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("post/2021-09-25-Basics-of-R-Programming/Layout.png"), error = FALSE)
```


## Code editor
You will write your code in this window. R used `#` as the comment character.  To assign a variable to a value we use `←` (lowercase followed by a dash).
 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("post/2021-09-25-Basics-of-R-Programming/Figures.png"), error = FALSE)
```
