### Talk on "Prediction of hydrological drought patterns in data scarce regions using catchmentsâ€™ physio-climatic attributes"

### I talked about 
- Climate change and water scarcity
- Current drought scenarios
- Relationship between Meteorological and hydrological drought
- Catchment characteristic to generalization drought pattern

### Key points 
fd

- We compute the relation between Hydrological and meteorological drought.
- Proposed the way to compute the lag between hydrological and meteorological drought.
- Framework to utilize the catchment characteristics for drought generalization of ungauged catchment.
