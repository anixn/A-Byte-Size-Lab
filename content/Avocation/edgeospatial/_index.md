Here, you'll find my collection of random yet fascinating data analysis projects, insights into software tools, and the workflows I rely on daily. This page serves as a collection of what I have learned apart from my day job or research. I've also shared a few videos on my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@edgeospatial"><font color="#007924"> @edgeospatial</font> </a>
, where I break down these topics in greater detail. Join me as I explore the world of tools, techniques, and creative solutions!
