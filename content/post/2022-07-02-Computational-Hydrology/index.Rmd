## Computational Hydrology 

Hydrology is the study of water across the earth system. I will tell you some interesting phenomenon of hydrology in this blog post(s). The main goal of writing post is to summarize the knowledge of Water resource and Hydrology. 

Mostly I will refer two books of hydrology _Applied Hydrology_ [@chow1988Applied] and _Rainfall-Runoff Modelling: The Primer_ [@beven2012Rainfallrunoff]
