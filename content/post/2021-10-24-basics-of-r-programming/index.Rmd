```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,    
                      collapse = TRUE
)
```

## Using R studio as R-IDE
R studio has multiple windows but the most important are Code editor, console, Environment variable pane, and plot output pane. 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R-Studio IDE have many pans.", out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("Layout.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Code editor
You will write your code in this window. R used `#` as the comment character.  To assign a variable to a value we use `←` (lowercase followed by a dash).
 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Do's and Don't while writing codes in R


1. Cases are important in R
2. Use of  ← and = carefully
