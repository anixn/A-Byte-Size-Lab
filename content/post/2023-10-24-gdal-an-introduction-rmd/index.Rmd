## Getting started with `gdal`

GDAL [(Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)](http://gdal.osgeo.org) is a free and open source translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing. It is used by many GIS software i.e. QGIS, ArcGIS, and GRASS GIS and R.

As a core R use, working in climate change and hydrology, I need to process spatia-tempral data daily on daily basis. GDAL provide various functions for make life easy for daily GIS users, at the same time I wish, I never have to leave the R enviornment and `rgdal` was a good alternative but it is retired and removed from CRAN
(See <https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/04/12/evolution.html>)

You can use GDAL in R with

- Use `sf` for vector data: Itâ€™s modern, efficient, and integrates seamlessly with GDAL.
- Use `terra` for raster data: It supports larger datasets and provides better performance than raster.
- Use `system()` for niche GDAL commands: When you need advanced features not directly exposed by R packages.

Now we'll explore the gdal command line utility to started with basic geospatial operations and later in the blog discuss how just usng `terra` and `sf` sufficient for most of regular geospatial needs.

### GDAL library capabilities

- GDAL offers both command-line and graphical user interfaces (such as QGIS), making it suitable for researchers with various preferences for interacting with geospatial data.
- GDAL provides bindings for popular programming languages like Python and R. This allows geospatial analysts to incorporate GDAL's capabilities into their data analysis and modeling workflows, aligning with your preference for using R.
- Beyond data conversion, GDAL provides capabilities for basic image processing, such as resampling, cropping, and filtering, which are essential for preparing data for further analysis.

GDAL algorithm provider has major categories of operation in vector and raster analysis:

1. Raster analysis
2. Raster conversion
3. Raster extraction
4. Raster miscellaneous (merge, raster calculator, etc.)
5. Raster projections
6. Vector conversion
7. Vector geoprocessing
8. Vector miscellaneous (build virtual vector, SQL, etc.)
