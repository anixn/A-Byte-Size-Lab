```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, collapse = TRUE)
```

The main aim of this blog to show how you can configure R, Python and SQL in a single Rmarkdown file. 

### Setup Python in Rstudio
To set up R Python And SQL in the Rstudio you have to first installed [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Miniconda helps to create python virtual environments and let you organize it. 
Such as for, data cleaning you might use a data cleaning environment for web scraping you will use a web scraping environment and so on.

###  Use conda prompt
I use conda prompt to create environment but some how those environment doesn't work with my R-reticulate, but if you are simply using python only them you can configure conda with the following commands.

#### Commands to manage conda prompt: 

1. `conda help` for help.
2. `conda create --name your_environment` to create a conda environment.
3. `conda env list` to list all the environment in conda.
4. `conda activate your_environment` to activate an specific conda environment.
5. To all some other chanel to download you can add package providers. But I tried `pip` and it worked just fine.
    1. `conda config --add channels conda-forge` | conda-forge is one of many channel.
    2. `conda config --set channel_priority strict` | set preference of channel (not sure!).
6. Install a few packages: `conda install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`

#### Commands to manage conda prompt inside RStudio:
Once you install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) You have to use [R-reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) in Rstudio, it is REPL (Read-eval-print loop) for Python in R, and helps to run Python code inside Rstudio. You can add miniconda into your windows terminal, but to use in Rstudio it is **recommended** to create and select environment from Rstudio itself.

Reticulate package provides all the necessary functionalities to run and manage python commands, such as 

- load reticulate package with `install.packages(reticulate)` command in R console. 
- command `conda_ create()` will create a new python environment.
- `use_condaenv(condaenv = "ENVNAME")` to select a newly created environment or existing python environment 
- to know the existing environments you might use `conda_list()` function.
- once you select a environment now you are ready to install python packages so use `py_install("PackageName")`.

### How to use SQL with Rmd files.
To use SQL in Rstudio simply use `dplyr`, `dbplyr`, and `RSQLite` packages. 

- Use Rmarkdown for everything
- Use SQL block to view the query output in ln-line mode.

### Example of R, Python, and SQL in Rmd file togather. 

```{r}
if(!require(dplyr)){install.packages("dplyr");library(dplyr)}
if(!require(dbplyr)){install.packages("dbplyr");library(dbplyr)}
if(!require(RSQLite)){install.packages("RSQLite");library(RSQLite)}

conn <- src_memdb() # create a SQLite database in memory

# Similar way you can add other database connections see `?dbplyr`
con_iso <- conn$con
copy_to(conn, 
        storms,     # this is a dataset built into dplyr
        overwrite = TRUE)
tbl(conn, sql("SELECT * FROM storms LIMIT 5"))

```

Run SQL queries in R you have to create a SLQ code chunk.

````{verbatim, lang="sql"}
```{sql connection=con_iso}
SELECT * FROM storms LIMIT 5;
```
````

```{sql connection=con_iso, echo=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM storms LIMIT 5;
```

SQL code chunk can ouput the data as r-environment variable i.e. `storm_preview` below.

````{verbatim, lang="sql"}
```{sql connection=con_iso, output.var="storm_preview"}
SELECT * FROM storms LIMIT 5;
```
````

```{sql connection=con_iso, output.var="storm_preview", echo=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM storms LIMIT 5;
```

````{verbatim, lang="R"}
```{r}
storm_preview 
```
````

```{r, echo=FALSE}
storm_preview # R code chunk
```

Now, load `reticulate` to run python codes. 

````{verbatim, lang="R"}
```{r}
if(!require(reticulate)){install.packages("reticulate");library(reticulate)}
```
````

```{r, echo = FALSE}
if(!require(reticulate)){install.packages("reticulate");library(reticulate)}
```

A example of Python code inside R markdown. 

````{verbatim, lang="R"}
```{python}
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt    
# Importing Numpy Library    
import numpy as np    
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')    
    
mu = 50    
sigma = 7    
x = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, size=200)    
fig, ax = plt.subplots()    
    
ax.hist(x, 20)    
ax.set_title('Historgram')    
ax.set_xlabel('bin range')    
ax.set_ylabel('frequency')    
    
fig.tight_layout()    
plt.show() # Comment out if you are using blogdown-sites to render the site. 
```
````

```{python, echo = FALSE}
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt    
# Importing Numpy Library    
import numpy as np    
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')    
    
mu = 50    
sigma = 7    
x = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, size=200)    
fig, ax = plt.subplots()    
    
ax.hist(x, 20)    
ax.set_title('Historgram')    
ax.set_xlabel('bin range')    
ax.set_ylabel('frequency')    
    
fig.tight_layout()    
# plt.show()    
```

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.cap="A figure python output of Histogram plot."}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure_1.png", error = FALSE)
```
