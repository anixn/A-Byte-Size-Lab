My fields of interest are Computational Hydrology, water resource management, and understating the catchment response under anthropogenic changes. In my doctorate, I worked on the approaches to identify the catchment vulnerability to environmental changes. 

My current research focuses on the development of a Physio-climatic catchment characteristics dataset for the Indian subcontinent that can be utilized for prediction in the ungauged basins. I possess a strong understanding of GIS processing and am efficient in Geo-spatial analysis. I am highly motivated in the field of data analysis (finding meaningful insights in data), skilled in programming with R, MATLAB, and Python scripting, and looking for inter-disciplinary research opportunities and collaboration. I am a passionate learner and trying to be a better teacher.
